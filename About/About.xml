	<description>Information spreads from one to another.

A continuation of ClosedDoors made by MoobyNooby, this mod changes how information spreads among your colonists.

I always find it strange that colonists are able to know things happening basically out of their sight, knowing to an extreme that they can react instantly. That's why I decide to take the baton, and finish what has been started: to make information spreading more realistic, and to create the inevitable desynchronization of understanding.

With the news-spreading mechanism well-defined and working smoothly across several thousands of colonies galaxy-wide, I present you this question: how much should your pure, innocent colonists know? Should they know everything that has happened in the game, whether big or small, whether bright or dark?
