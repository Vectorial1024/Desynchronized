		<content>Greetings, mod user. Thank you for using &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt;, a WIP mod that aims to change how Colonists react to the outside world.|The only change in this update is that &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt; now requires HugsLib, which is also the reason why you are reading this right now.|Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<content>A slightly overdue update! But who cares; at least we got this mod updated. Yay!|&lt;b&gt;Implemented Mandatory Censorship Scheme&lt;/b&gt;
The Scheme filteres information about the following events that originate from outside the Colonists' home-base:|- Executions, Organ Harvests, and Banishments
- Prisoners Sold
- Colonist Died and associated thoughts|Note that the vanilla game has already implemented a similar Scheme to filter the following events:|- Know Butchered Human
- Buried in Sarcophagus
- Colonist Left Unburied.|&lt;b&gt;On a more serious note:&lt;/b&gt;
- Reduced Steam Workshop file size thanks to PublisherPlus
- Changing the direction of this mod from a simple, low-level "Gulag mod" to a complex, high-level "Censorship mod"|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

- More kidnap-related thoughts to come in later v1.2.* updates|I have also implemented a script that logs the Tales of kidnapped Colonists onto your desktop when DevMode is turned on.

		<content>I originally planned to upload a holiday special v1.2.2 a few days ago, but couldn't make it, so now, we have this huge update to Desynchronized: the version 1.3.0!|- Major rewrite of underlying code to conform to the "information system" standard
- Effects of existing features are unchanged
- Kidnaps: now has all the family-relation Thoughts like "my grandfather was kidnapped", "my cousin was kidnapped" etc.
- Banishment: new placeholder letter for when you banish a Colonist
- Executions: new placeholder letter for when you execute a Colonist/Guest (Prisoners are technically Guests)
- Organ Harvests: no new features (i.e., should work just as before)
- Slight (maybe non-noticable) optimization: game no longer attempts to give out thoughts when pawns are downed
- Fixed bug: Colonists should now not know about Executions happening outside of their home map (for real this time)|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, and detailed changelogs.</content>

- (Residue bugs from previous version's savefile may still be around, but should be less severe)
- Included "Prisoner/Colonist sold" into the "information system"
- Fixed bug: Gifting Colonists to Factions via drop-pods should now give mood debuff; this debuff applies to those in the map where the pods were launched

		<content>It's finally here: Version 1.4. After 2 months in development, I am proud to announce that we have reached a major milestone of development: the completion of the news-spreading system.|- New concept: Tale-News (TN). A TN is a representation of an in-game event that has occured. The list of in-game events that can be represented by  the TN system will be expanded in the future as development continues. Details are on GitHub.
- New behavior: TN spreading. When doing chit-chat and deep-talk, the initiator has a small chance to tell the recipient one entry of TN. Details are on GitHub.
- New settings: You have the option to disable the TN-spreading behavior (which is enabled by default). Consult your Mod Settings for details.
- Known issue: (Steam only) Mod size boomed back up to 20MB. PublisherPlus died after the recent RimWorld update.|Many thanks to the cumulative 7000 subscribers of this mod!

- New trait spectrum related to NST: Gossiper (+0.03 NST) and Secret-keeper (-0.015 NST). This trait spectrum is less common than average.

- Fixed bug: spreading news should no longer give the sender another mood debuff of the same event
- Changed news spread base chance due to traits from 5%/2%/0.05% to 40%/25%/10%
- Changed feature: Increased the number of dice throw from 3 to 5 for Deep Talk news spread checking
- Changed data structure to minimize size of data inside save-files

		<assemblyVersion>1.5.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>So many things have happened since the last proper update, and so much uncertainty await in the future, and here we are, packing version 1.5.0 for all to use.|- New feature: Pawns referenced by TaleNews will be kept by the game as world pawns
- Hence, fixed bug: No more NullReferenceException when passing news (finally)
- New feature: This mod will verify and fix most of its data when a savefile is loaded to make sure only valid data is loaded by the game
- New feature: Pawns now assign a "news importance" score to every news they have received
- New feature: News that have a higher importance score will be more likely to be transmitted
- New feature: The news importance of pawn's death depends on several factors, but it mainly depends on the relationship between the news receiver and the victim
- Note: News importance will naturally decay over time
- Note: Other news types currently have place-holder, constant importance scores
- Fixed bug: Selling pawns to other factions should no longer give "Loved one sold" thoughts to pawns off-map|With the newly-implemented, standardized self-verification feature, this update does not require you to start a new game. However, the self-verification will remove most of the existing TaleNews about pawn death because most of them are invalid; the victims they are describing are already discarded by the game, so the TaleNews become invalid. A handful of TaleNews are not affected, especially those about recent deaths (deaths in the last 24 in-game hours).|Colonies that rely on hunting and butchering will be most affected by this update since their games and poultries are forcibly retained even after their death. Hence, the next update will introduce "forgetfulness" to pawns. News with low importance will be "forgotten", allowing the dead to finally rest and pass on.|If you would like to include your error logs when reporting bugs, you are recommended to use PasteBin ( https://pastebin.com/ ) or HugsLib's log-sharing feature.|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, detailed changelogs and elaboration of features.</content>

- Fixed bug: no more ArgumentOutOfRangeException when attempting to randomly select a piece of news to transmit
- Cleaned up left-over developer log spam|I have come up with a good way to manage translations.
