          Example text from Boodlust:
          {PAWN_nameDef} gets a rush from hurting people, and never minds the sight of blood or death. {PAWN_pronoun} is four times as likely to start a social fight as others.

          - Dislikes violence (but will tolerate)
          - Dislikes blood
          - (Consider converting this to a spectrum trait)
