Life is full of stories; it's just whether you wanna pay attention to them. The v1.7 branch will focus on adding more types of news for your Colonists to share.

- New feature: Built-in Psychology support; now also handles Bleeding Heart, Desensitized, etc.
- More Trad-Chinese translations 填補了繁中翻譯的各空洞
- Some texts from v1.6 now open for translation
- Fixed some bugs
  - No more NullReferenceException while transmitting news by ignoring invalid news entries
  - No more double My Organ Was Harvested debuff (Oooh yeah)
- Cleaned up some more code

There are some problems with the current way of "handling" caravan member news transmission. It is found that vanilla RimWorld never had *any* code to let caravan members interact with each other, so the current way of relying on social interactions will not work. A workaround is needed.

If you would like to include your error logs when reporting bugs, you may use PasteBin ( https://pastebin.com/ ) or HugsLib's log-sharing feature.

This is the v1.7.0 version of Desynchronized: Tales and News. Support for Psychology, which was originally planned to be a separate mod, has been integrated back into the main mod. The v1.7 branch will add in (hopefully) more types of tale-news to be transmitted by your pawns, making the life on the Rim more fruitful and eventful.

# Changelog
- New feature: Built-in Psychology support; now also handles Bleeding Heart, Desensitized, etc.
  - Hence, closed #1 and #7 (wohooo #1 is closed!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS)
- More Trad-Chinese translations 填補了繁中翻譯的各空洞
  - Those translations were supposed to be there in v1.6, but I forgot about them
- Some texts from v1.6 now open for translation
- Fixed some bugs
  - No more NullReferenceException while transmitting news by ignoring news entries forgotten by pawns; I believe such news entries are invalid anyway, so transmitting them will cause errors
  - No more double My Organ Was Harvested debuff (a fix for Psychology)
- Cleaned up some more code
