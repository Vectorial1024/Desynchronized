Even the strong can, one day, become weak. The v2.0 branch provides basic support of the mod for vanilla v1.1.

- Updated to RimWorld v1.1 (parallel to existing v1.0 version (v1.7.*))
- Pawn Kidnapped now uses the vanilla Pawn Lost thought family instead of the custom Pawn Kidnapped thought family
- Disabled custom fix for unblocked Colonist Left Unburied thought since this fix should already be in vanilla game
- Rewritten code that patches vanilla behavior
- Add/fix selling bonded animals now gives relevant Bonded Animal Sold thought to pet owners as required by v1.1
- Disabled integrated Psychology compatibility until further notice
- Dementia patients no longer forget news when Confused Wandering starts

I have noticed that Psychology is currently experiencing a no-update breakdown. This is similar to what happened to ClosedDoors back when RimWorld v1.0 was released. I won't be providing support to any Psychology until both sides (Psychology and here) have settled down.
