This mod would not have been here without the following people:
- Tynan and Ludeon: for making this game
- pardeike's Harmony library and UnlimitedHugs' HugsLib: for providing much-needed convenience to make mods
- MoobyNooby: for open-sourcing the original ClosedDoors so his code can be passed on
- Mihokyo: for providing the French translations
- The many subscribers (especially the early ones): for supporting this *ex-*WIP product by subscribing to it
- ~~Jaxe: for making the amazing [PublisherPlus](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510554297)~~
- Mehni: for forking and updating the amazing [PublisherPlus](https://github.com/Mehni/PublisherPlus); PublisherPlus allowed me to exclude unneccesary files during upload, reducing mod size to less than 2 MB.
- SrGrafo: for (possibly) (indirectly?) inspiring the creation of this mod [the comic](https://rimworldme.tumblr.com/post/165485304313/innocent-prisoners-of-rimworld)

And perhaps there are even more that have helped me along the way. Allow me to give thanks to those ones collectively!
