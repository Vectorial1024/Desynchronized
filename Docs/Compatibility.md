# Compatibility Information
## On Save-Game Compatibility
Adding this mod to an existing savegame should not cause any problems, but removing this from an existing one may cause problems.

We are considering adding some sort of safe-stop feature to allow users to remove this mod safely without breaking their saves.
## On Cross-Mod Compatibility
Well, there seems to have a lot of mods that could play well with this mod. Here is a list of mods that I think will require work:
- Rumor Has It
- Questionable Ethics
- Blood Pack
- Brain in a Jar
- (probably even more)

**Full Compatibility**
This mod works fine without problems with the following mods:

**Partial Compatibility**
This mod may have some issues with the following mods, but should still function most of the time:
- RuntimeGC (verified on 31 May, 2019)
  - The "deconstruct animal family" will invalidate some Tale-News
- Psychology (verified on 30 July, 2019)
  - Mod too large, can't be confident that the compatibility is complete

This mod simply does not function as intended with the following mods:
- Real Fog of War (verified on 10 Nov, 2018): See #22.
